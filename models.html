            <!-- Since the first-generation model began competing in the World Rally Championship (WRC), the Subaru Impreza has been synonymous with rally racing, especially the top-of-the-line WRX STi model. With the second-generation Impreza, Subaru pushed the envelope even further, creating a high-profile that took the WRC theme to a new level, the WRX STi Spec C Type RA. -->
            <!-- This car, based on the STi Spec C - which in itself was already capable of a very high level of performance - was the ultimate rally car for the streets, with an extremely lightweight body and a powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-4 that pumped out 276 BHP and 311.0 lb-ft of torque. The Type RA received additional STi aerodynamic parts, 17-inch aluminum wheels, special stainless-steel exhaust and 5-level adjustable dampers. -->
            <!-- The "RA" in the model name stands for "Record Attempt", a reference to Subaru's assault on the Nürburgring in the spring of 2004. A final prototype of the reworked WRX STi Spec C achieved a lap time of 7 minutes 59.41 seconds. Breaking the 8-minute barrier that represented the hallmark for production cars. And at the 2005 Nürburgring 24-Hour race, a nearly production-spec model was entered and finished 2nd in its class. -->
            <!-- Limited to only 350 units, the Spec C Type RA went on sale in August 2005. -->
